============================================

apirequest.m
- Snippet from a personal venture with a friend of mine. Dove right into objective-c and fell in love - wrote enough to begin working directly with the API we built for the app. By the end of the weekend sprint, I was successfully making authenticated requests, parsing responses, and displaying them within a view. 

mapbox.js
- Written on top of the [Mapbox API](https://www.mapbox.com/) to provide our visitors with an interface for getting directions. Scripted in support for visitors coming to the page 'sideways' from directions-related copy or calls to action so they didn't have to hit a brick wall. 

new-project-setup.scss
- Current project I'm involved with - 'BLDR' - a talent calculator and character build community for [Guild Wars 2](https://www.guildwars2.com/en/). Previous work had been done in vanilla css by another developer; I started rewriting the app using Sass. Frameworks of choice were [bourbon](http://bourbon.io/), [neat](http://neat.bourbon.io/), and [typeplate](http://typeplate.com/). Working directly with Griffin Macaulay, the illustrator for [Skulls of the Shogun](http://skullsoftheshogun.com/).

selectbox-url-linking.js
- Scripted on top of [selectboxit](http://gregfranko.com/jquery.selectBoxIt.js/) to allow us to populate the select with working links. 

titanium-reverse-geolocation.js
- Part of a holiday app for a company I contracted for previously - was my first time attempting to do something beyond DOM manipulation with js, and my first time working within the native mobile world. Written on top of [Titanium](http://www.appcelerator.com/titanium/titanium-sdk/), the view successfully pulled current coordinates from a user's phone, passed them to Google for a readable address, put the returned address into a url, and then built a set of directions around it to point the user to our offices. App was accepted to the app store and was available for a couple of months.
